# Sambhāṣa! — Student Course Feedback System

A secure full-stack student course feedback application where students can sign up, log in, submit ratings & feedback on courses, manage their profile (with optional profile picture upload), and admins can manage users, courses, and analyze feedback trends.

## Project Overview

This project provides a complete developer-ready codebase (backend + frontend) for building and running a course feedback system:

- Students can sign up / log in, submit/edit/delete their feedback (rating + message), and update profile (name, phone, DOB, address, picture).

- Admin can view all feedback, filter & export to CSV, manage students and courses, and view analytics (average rating per course, totals).

- Backend: Node.js, Express.

- Frontend: React (hooks, functional components), protected routes.

Project aimed to be secure by default with input validation, hashed passwords (bcrypt), JWT authentication, and role-based authorization.
